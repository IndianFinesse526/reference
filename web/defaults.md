# Defaults
Whenever a HTML file isn't directly referenced in the link it goes to directory default or lists the contents of an entire folder if there is not one available.

# Creating a default file
Create or rename a file to `index.html` in the directory you are trying to set a default for and follow the normal process for HTML.
